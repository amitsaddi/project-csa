# Decoupled Architecture

### Tightly Coupled System

- A system architecture of components that are not just linked together but are
  also dependent upon each other.
- If one component fails, all component fails.

### Loosely Coupled/Decoupled Systems

- Multiple components that can process information without being connected.
- Components are not connected - if one fails, the rest of the system can
  continue processing (fault tolerant/highly available)

### AWS Services that are used for distributed/decoupled system architectures

- SWF (Simple Work Flow Service)
- SQS (Simple Queue Service)
