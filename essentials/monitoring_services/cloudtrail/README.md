# CloudTrail

- CloudTrail is an API logging service that logs all API calls made to AWS.
- It does not matter if the API calls from the command line, SDK, or console.
- All created logs are placed into a designated S3 bucket - so they are highly available by default.
- CloudTrail logs helps when addressing security concerns, by allowing you to
  view what actions users on your AWS account have performed.
- Since AWS is just one big API - CloudTrail can log ever single action taken in
  your account.
