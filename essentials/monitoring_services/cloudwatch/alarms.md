# CloudWatch Alarms

- CloudWatch Alarms allow for you (or the system admin) to be notified when
  certain defined thresholds are met on CloudWatch Metrics.
- For example, you can setup an alarm to be triggered whenever the
  CPUUtilization metric on an EC2 instance goes above 70%.
- Alarms can also be used to trigger other events in AWS like publishing to an
  SNS topic or triggering auto scaling.
