# VPC Flow Logs

- VPC Flow Logs allow you to collect information about the IP traffic going to
  and from network interfaces in your VPC.
- VPC Flow Log data is stored in a log group in CloudWatch.
- Flow logs can be created on a specific VPC, Subnet or Network Interface.
- Flow logs created on a VPC or Subnet will include all network interfaces in
  that VPC or subnet.
- Each network interface will have its own unique log stream.
- You can set the log to capture data on accepted traffic, rejected traffic, or all traffic.
- Flow logs are NOT captured in "real-time". The capture window is approx. 10
  minutes, then daata is published.
- VPC Flow Logs consist of network traffic for a specific 5-tuple.
- A 5-tuple is a set of five different values that comprise a TCP/IP connection.
  It includes:
  - (1) Source IP and (2) source port number
  - (3) Destination IP address and (4) destination port number
  - (5) Protocol

#### Benefits

- Troubleshoot why certain traffic is not reaching an EC2 instance.
- An added security layer by allowing you to monitor the traffic that reaches
  your EC2 instances.

#### Limitations of VPC Flow Logs

Traffics NOT captured by VPC Flow Logs

- Traffic between an EC2 instance and an Amazon DNS Server
- Traffic generated by request for instance metadata (request to 169.254.169.254)
- DHCP traffic
