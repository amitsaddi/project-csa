# S3 Buckets

- Buckets are the main storage container of S3, and contain a grouping of
  information and have sub name spaces that are similar to folders (but yet are
  called folders).

- Tags can be used to organize buckets (i.e tag based on application the bucket
  belongs to)

- Each bucket must have a unique name across ALL of AWS.


#### Bucket Limitations

- Only 100 buckets can be created in an AWS account at a time.
- Bucket ownership cannot be transferred once a bucket is created.
