# Root Account
- The user created when you first create your AWS account is called the "root"
  user.
- It's credentials are the email address and password used when signing up for
  your AWS account.
- By default, the root user has FULL administrative rights and access to every
  part of the account.

### Best practices

- You should not use root user for daily work and AWS administration.
- You should create a second user that has admin rights and sign in as that user
  for daily work.
- You should always protect your root account with MFA.
