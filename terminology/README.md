# CSA Terminology

### High Availability

Refers to systems that are durable and likely to operate continuously without
failure for a long time. For a SA, this means making sure your application
(hosted in AWS) is always available when a user/customer tries to access it.

### Fault Tolerance

Is the property that enables a system to configure operating properly in the
event of the failure of one or more of its component. A fault tolerant
application (in AWS) would be where one of its web server can fail, and still
server traffic to visitors (and even repair itself i.e auto scaling).

### Scalability

The ability of a system to easily increase in size and capacity in a cost
effective way (usually based on usage demand).

### Elasticity

The ability of a system to increase and decrease in size (usually based on usage
demand). In architecting applications, this usually refers to the ability of an
application to increase and decrease server capacity on demand.

### Cost Efficient

Choosing the correct options to make a system as inexpensive as possible.

### Secure

Following proper guidelines and practices to secure a system.

### AWS Best Practices

A set of guidelines outlined by AWS that should be followed when provisioning
and using their services.
